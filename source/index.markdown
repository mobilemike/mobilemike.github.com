Hello
-----
My name is Mike and I'm looking for a a company to to help me reboot my career.

For almost 10 years, I've been climbing the corporate ladder of enterprise IT. Recently, I've been growing more and more displeased with the state of my industry. Buy over build, lack of integration, never taking projects past 80%, zero respect for the benefits of open source; the list goes on and on.

This summer I took the leap. I quit my systems architecture position to give me the time necessary to pursue new career somewhere in the Ruby/Rails ecosystem. Unlike most developers, my story and background are a bit different, so please bear with me. My resume highlights my past engineering and leadership skills. Please allow me to explain my development background in more detail.

I've been using Ruby in a hobby capacity for 5 years. I attended Rails Conf '07 and learned an immense amount about Rails and the ecosystem in general. In 2009 I attended the Pragmatic Studio's Ruby on Rails course. When I returned, I immediately began work on an internal app for my employer; one that they still use today. It was never the focus of my job to do development, but I had been bitten by the bug and there is no going back. To take the next step, I need to put these skills to work in a professional capacity.

I have a genuine passion for technology, and from what I've seen, it looks like ****XXXXX**** does too. After getting a brief chance to use the product today, I'm very interested in what you're doing. I already have number of questions, but I'll hold those until a later discussion.

Right now, I'm working on my own applications and focusing on the areas where I need to improve. Please take a [Not Visited] look at my [GitHub account] to see examples of both my old and new code. I've also attached a copy of my resume to help you understand the work I've done in the past.

I'm certainly not an advanced developer, but I have a real hunger to improve. I'm excited for an opportunity to work ***XXXXX***, an opportunity to grow my skills while also delivering value to the team. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Mike Karolow
